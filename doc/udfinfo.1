.TH UDFINFO 1 "udftools" "Commands"

.SH NAME
udfinfo \- show information about UDF filesystem

.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "udfinfo [ options ] " device

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBudfinfo\fP shows various information about a UDF filesystem stored either on
the block device or in the disk file image. The output from the \fBudfinfo\fP is
suitable for parsing by external applications or scripts.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-h,\-\-help
Display the usage and the list of options.

.TP
.BI \-b,\-\-blocksize= " block\-size "
Specify the size of blocks in bytes. Valid block size for a UDF file system is
power of two in range from 512 to 32768 and must match a device logical (sector)
size. If omitted, \fBudfinfo\fP tries to autodetect block size. It tries logical
(sector) size and then all valid block sizes.

.TP
.BI \-\-vatblock= " vat\-block "
Specify the block location of the Virtual Allocation Table. Virtual Allocation
Table is present only on UDF disks with Virtual Partition Map and must be at the
last written/recorded disk block.

If omitted, \fBudfinfo\fP for optical disc tries to detect the last recorded
block with fallback to the last block of block device or disk file image. In
most cases this fallback does not have to work and for disk file images with
Virtual Allocation Table is necessary to specify correct location.

Virtual Allocation Table contains locations of UDF disk blocks needed to read
data storage, determinate used and free space blocks, read File Set Identifier
and calculate Windows specific Volume Serial Number.

.TP
.B \-\-locale
Encode UDF string identifiers on output according to current locale settings
(default).

.TP
.B \-\-u8
Encode UDF string identifiers on output to 8 bit OSTA Compressed Unicode format,
equivalent to Latin1 (ISO-8859-1). This will work only for strings which Unicode
code points are below U+100.

.TP
.B \-\-u16
Encode UDF string identifiers on output to 16 bit OSTA Compressed Unicode
format, equivalent to UCS-2BE.

.TP
.B \-\-utf8
Encode UDF string identifiers on output to UTF-8.

.SH "EXIT STATUS"
\fBudfinfo\fP returns 0 if successful, non-zero if there are problems like block
device does not contain UDF filesystem.

.SH OUTPUT FORMAT
First part of the \fBudfinfo\fP standard output contains information in
\fIkey\fP=\fIvalue\fP format. List of all keys with their meaning are in the
following table:

.RS
.TP 1.6i
filename
File name of the selected block device or disk file image
.TP
label
label is an alias for \fIlvid\fP, see section \fBUDF label and UUID\fP
.TP
uuid
UUID are first 16 hexadecimal lowercase digits of \fIfullvsid\fP, but see
section \fBUDF label and UUID\fP
.TP
lvid
UDF Logical Volume Identifier stored in UDF Logical Volume Descriptor
.TP
vid
UDF Volume Identifier stored in UDF Primary Volume Descriptor
.TP
vsid
\fIfullvsid\fP after \fIuuid\fP part, typically 17.-127. character
.TP
fsid
UDF File Set Identifier stored in UDF File Set Descriptor
.TP
fullvsid
UDF Volume Set Identifier stored in UDF Primary Volume Descriptor
.TP
winserialnum
Windows specific Volume Serial Number
.TP
blocksize
UDF block size
.TP
blocks
Number of all blocks on the selected block device or disk file image
.TP
usedblocks
Number of used space blocks on UDF disk for data storage
.TP
freeblocks
Number of free space blocks on UDF disk for data storage
.TP
behindblocks
Number of blocks which are behind the last block used by UDF disk
.TP
numfiles
Number of stored files on UDF disk
.TP
numdirs
Number of stored directories on UDF disk
.TP
udfrev
UDF revision needed for reading UDF disk
.TP
udfwriterev
UDF revision needed for writing or modifying UDF disk
.TP
integrity
UDF integrity of Logical Volume, one of: \fIopened\fP, \fIclosed\fP,
\fIunknown\fP
.TP
accesstype
UDF Access Type, one of: \fIoverwritable\fP, \fIrewritable\fP, \fIwriteonce\fP,
\fIreadonly\fP, \fIpseudo\-overwritable\fP, \fIunknown\fP
.RE

When UDF integrity is not \fIclosed\fP it means that the UDF disk was not
properly unmounted, is in inconsistent state and needs repairing.

All UDF string identifiers are stored on UDF disk in Unicode, therefore they are
locale or code page agnostic. Options \fB\-\-locale\fP, \fB\-\-u8\fP,
\fB\-\-u16\fP and \fB\-\-utf8\fP controls how are identifiers encoded on output.

All newline characters from the UDF string identifiers are removed, so it is
guaranteed that the newline character is present only as a separator.

Second part of the \fBudfinfo\fP standard output contains list of UDF block
types stored on device, one per line in the following format:

.RS
start=\fIblock\-num\fP, blocks=\fIblock\-count\fP, type=\fIblock\-type\fP
.RE

With meaning that \fIblock\-type\fP starts at UDF block \fIblock\-num\fP and
span \fIblock\-count\fP blocks on device.

.SH UDF label and UUID
UDF specification does not say anything about a disk label but describe that UDF
Logical Volume Identifier is extremely important field for media identification
in a jukebox as that field is displayed to the user. And based on this statement
it is a common practice for majority of UDF implementations to use UDF Logical
Volume Identifier as a UDF disk label.

UDF specification does not have concept of disk UUID like other filesystems. But
mandates that the first 16 characters of UDF Volume Set Identifier are unique,
a non-fixed and a non-trivial value. Plus first eight characters are hexadecimal
digits. Windows application format.exe is known to violates this requirement and
set only the first 8 characters as unique (others are fixed). Because more UDF
implementations use in the first 16 characters only hexadecimal digits and all
compliant UDF implementations have hexadecimal digits in the first 8 characters,
the following algorithm for generating stable UUID was informally chosen and now
is used by udftools, util-linux, grub2 and other projects:

.RS
0. If Volume Set Identifier has less then 8 characters then stop with empty UUID
.br
1. Take the first 16 bytes from UTF-8 encoded string of Volume Set Identifier
.br
2. If all bytes are hexadecimal digits then use their lowercase form as UUID
.br
3. If first 8 bytes are not all hexadecimal digits then convert those 8 bytes to
their hexadecimal representation (resulting in 16 bytes) and use as UUID
.br
4. Otherwise, compose UUID from two 8 byte parts:
.RS
1. part: Use lowercase form of the first 8 bytes (which are hexadecimal digits)
.br
2. part: Convert next 4 bytes (9.-12. pos.) to their hexadecimal representation
.RE
.RE

Which means that this generated UUID has always 16 hexadecimal lowercase digits.
In most cases this UUID matches case-insensitively the first 16 characters of
UDF Volume Set Identifier and for all disks compliant to the UDF specification
the first 8 bytes of UUID matches case-insensitively the first 8 characters of
UDF Volume Set Identifier. In that algorithm was chosen UTF-8 encoding because
it is the only commonly used Unicode transformation to bytes with fixed points
in all hexadecimal digits.

Windows specific \fIVolume Serial Number\fP is a non-standard 32 bit checksum,
calculated as four separate 8 bit XOR checksums of 512 bytes long UDF File Set
Descriptor. Therefore it cannot be set or changed as opposite to UUID which is
moreover 64 bit long. This non-standard checksum is used only by Windows systems
(since Windows 98 era when it was introduced) and can be displayed on Windows
systems by applications like \fBvol\fP, \fBdir\fP or \fBfsutil\fP.

.SH LIMITATIONS
\fBudfinfo\fP is not able to read Metadata Partition and Virtual Allocation
Table stored outside of Information Control Block yet. Therefore determining
used and free space blocks, reading File Set Identifier and calculating Windows
specific Volume Serial Number may not be available for some Write Once media
and disks with UDF revisions higher then 2.01 which have Metadata Partition.
